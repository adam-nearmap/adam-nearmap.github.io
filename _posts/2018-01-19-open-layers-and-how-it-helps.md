title: OpenLayers and how it helps
---

Here at Nearmap we have been using OpenLayers to build and enhance our map browser. For anyone that is not familiar with OpenLayers. It is an open source code libarary that allows developers to build a map browser using JavaScript as the base. This can be as basic as just an interactive map that allows you to zoom in and move around the map. To a complete mapping tool that will allow you to use satelite tiles, measure landscapes, siteplanning for building sites and many more functionality you can think up. 

When starting with OpenLayers I found that the API documentation and their examples were really usefull. You can find their API documentation [**here**](http://openlayers.org/en/latest/apidoc/). The big benefit I have found with their API documentation is that everything is clearly laid out and well documented. For exmaple if you are looking at adding the ability to draw lines on your map the documentation clearly outlines all the options you have in setting up and displaying the line. You can also find good examples on how this has been done. The added advantage of all the examples OpenLayers has is that the examples can be opened in [**codepen**](https://codepen.io/) this gives you a nice and easy way of modifying the standard code to discover what you can do with the feature you want to use. 

In practical terms the documentation and the code examples shown on thier site allows us to easily prototype an idea. The advantage of this is that you can see what is possible before you start integrating the code into your own enviroment. It will also help you plan how to add the code into your own project. The benefit of doing this is that it will allow you to focus more on fine tuning and improving the functionality on your own project than worrying about whether it will work or not. Using this methos also gave me the oputunity to explore the code more so that I could add more enhancements to the feature I was adding to our map browser.
